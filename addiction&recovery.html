  <p>A comprehensive guide for healing from addiction, trauma, and mental health challenges</p>
</header>

<main>
  <details class="accordion" open>
    <summary>1. Commitment to Healing</summary>
    <div class="content">
      <p>Recovery starts with a sincere decision to heal and improve your life. It requires ongoing willingness to face challenges, even when it’s uncomfortable.</p>
    </div>
  </details>

  <details class="accordion">
    <summary>2. Building a Strong Support Network</summary>
    <div class="content">
      <p>Surround yourself with people who understand, support, and respect your journey. This can include family, friends, therapists, support groups (like AA, NA, or mental health peer groups), and community resources. Connection combats isolation, which is a big risk factor for relapse or setbacks.</p>
    </div>
  </details>

  <details class="accordion">
    <summary>3. Seeking Professional Guidance</summary>
    <div class="content">
      <p>Access to therapists, counselors, medical professionals, or addiction specialists. Sometimes includes medication or specialized treatment (e.g., trauma therapy, medication-assisted treatment for addiction). Professional care helps navigate complex emotions and physical symptoms safely.</p>
    </div>
  </details>

  <details class="accordion">
    <summary>4. Understanding Yourself and Your Triggers</summary>
    <div class="content">
      <p>Learn about what leads to relapse or emotional overwhelm. Reflect on your thoughts, feelings, and behaviors — through journaling, therapy, or mindfulness. Recognize your personal patterns and early warning signs.</p>
    </div>
  </details>

  <details class="accordion">
    <summary>5. Developing Healthy Coping Skills</summary>
    <div class="content">
      <p>Replace harmful behaviors with positive strategies: meditation, breathing exercises, creative arts, exercise, or grounding techniques. Practice self-soothing and stress reduction regularly. Learn to tolerate discomfort without turning to old habits.</p>
    </div>
  </details>

  <details class="accordion">
    <summary>6. Creating Stability Through Routine</summary>
    <div class="content">
      <p>Structure your day with healthy habits and routines — sleep schedule, meal times, work, and relaxation. Goal setting (short and long term) keeps focus and builds confidence. Having predictable anchors in your day reduces chaos and uncertainty.</p>
    </div>
  </details>

  <details class="accordion">
    <summary>7. Practicing Self-Compassion</summary>
    <div class="content">
      <p>Accept that recovery is a process with progress and setbacks. Don’t judge yourself harshly for mistakes or relapses — treat yourself as you would a friend. Patience with yourself creates a safe internal environment for growth.</p>
    </div>
  </details>

  <details class="accordion">
    <summary>8. Continuing Education and Personal Growth</summary>
    <div class="content">
      <p>Learn about addiction, trauma, mental health conditions, and recovery science. Work on building emotional intelligence, communication skills, and resilience. Seek out workshops, books, podcasts, or online resources.</p>
    </div>
  </details>

  <details class="accordion">
    <summary>9. Finding Purpose and Meaning</summary>
    <div class="content">
      <p>Connect to your values, spirituality, or passions. Engage in activities that inspire you or make you feel useful. Helping others or volunteering can create a sense of belonging and contribution.</p>
    </div>
  </details>

  <details class="accordion">
    <summary>10. Taking Care of Your Body</summary>
    <div class="content">
      <p>Prioritize adequate sleep, nutritious food, and regular physical activity. Address any medical needs or chronic conditions. Physical wellness supports mental and emotional health.</p>
    </div>
  </details>

  <details class="accordion">
    <summary>11. Managing Mental Health Holistically</summary>
    <div class="content">
      <p>Address co-occurring issues like anxiety, depression, PTSD, or bipolar disorder. Use therapy, medication, lifestyle changes, and support tailored to your needs. Monitor mood and seek help early when symptoms arise.</p>
    </div>
  </details>

  <details class="accordion">
    <summary>12. Setting Boundaries</summary>
    <div class="content">
      <p>Learn to say no to toxic people, unhealthy environments, or situations that threaten your recovery. Protect your energy and focus by surrounding yourself with positive influences.</p>
    </div>
  </details>

  <details class="accordion">
    <summary>13. Using Tools and Resources</summary>
    <div class="content">
      <p>Keep recovery toolkits handy — crisis plans, grounding exercises, motivational quotes. Use apps, journals, or community programs to support daily progress. Celebrate milestones, no matter how small.</p>
