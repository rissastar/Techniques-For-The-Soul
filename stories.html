      <h3>‚Äî Larissa Wood</h3>
<p>By blood, by love, by fire and fight ‚Äî we are still standing.
‚∏ª
It started small ‚Äî a silent crack,
When life first knocked my mother back.
A steering wheel, a cliffside bend,
A pain too loud she tried to end.

They called it a crash, said she fell asleep,
But it was grief that cut her soul too deep.
She didn‚Äôt want to die, just disappear,
From all the weight she held for years.

The wreckage left her back in pain,
Her eyes blackened, her soul stained.
That Christmas, she could barely see,
Still tried to smile for you and me.

They handed her pills with kindness blind,
Not knowing what they‚Äôd soon unwind.
Percocets for her broken spine,
But they numbed her heart and stole her mind.

What started as healing became a need,
An ache in her bones she had to feed.
And slowly, softly, she began to drift,
Her laughter quiet, her presence missed.

She‚Äôd lock the door and stay inside,
While parts of her began to hide.
I‚Äôd peek through cracks, see what I feared‚Äî
A mother close, yet never near.

She‚Äôd say she was working, off to bingo,
But night stretched long, and hope moved slow.
Sometimes she wouldn‚Äôt come home till dawn,
And I‚Äôd still be waiting with curtains drawn.

There were moments she tried ‚Äî she truly did,
But addiction‚Äôs louder than love for your kid.
She went to rehab more than once,
And each time, I held onto hope like a punch.

But I remember the one time she left too soon,
Checked herself out beneath the moon.
Everyone thought she was healing that week,
But she was lost ‚Äî I couldn‚Äôt speak.

And then the day that broke our backs ‚Äî
July 1st, I remember the facts.
The doorbell rang, police in frame,
And I already knew, I felt the shame.

She was sleeping late ‚Äî past noon,
And suddenly the world emptied the room.
My brother answered, I couldn‚Äôt breathe,
My mother crying, ‚ÄúPlease, don‚Äôt leave!‚Äù

She fell to the floor, her voice a scream,
As they took her babies, stole the dream.
My sister was three, went to her dad,
Me and my brother ‚Äî the system we had.

Our dad was drowning in his own despair,
So we were sent to foster care.
For 22 days, our Nan held tight,
But they took us again, said it wasn‚Äôt right.

Back and forth, to grandparents‚Äô arms,
Trying to find peace, escape the harm.
But teens with trauma, anger, grief,
Don‚Äôt find calm or quick relief.

We didn‚Äôt know what ‚Äúhome‚Äù should mean,
Sometimes pushed love away unseen.
But finally, we found a place so warm ‚Äî
A family who held us through every storm.

And all the while, my mom still tried,
Even as parts of her soul just cried.
She battled shame, she fought the tide,
She mourned the visits where she‚Äôd arrive ‚Äî
Too late, too high, or not at all,
Still drowning in her painful fall.

I thought for years it was our fault,
That maybe we had caused her halt.
But it wasn‚Äôt us ‚Äî it was the weight,
Of sorrow, guilt, and twist of fate.

In Alberta, we crossed paths once more,
She was pregnant, lost, and sore.
That baby boy she bore with grace,
Was taken from her ‚Äî a missing face.

Adopted out, a ghost we know,
A brother whose name we don‚Äôt get to show.
I met him once ‚Äî a fleeting smile,
My siblings haven‚Äôt, not in a while.

My sister too, was moved again,
Placed with kind and gentle kin.
And we were torn, across the land,
No games, no hugs, no holding hands.

Our childhood split, love on a clock,
Planned-out visits, padlocked talk.
And still, through all, she tried to mend,
To prove she could be mom again.

She came back once, I still recall ‚Äî
Sober, smiling, standing tall.
Hair was cut, her face was full,
Eyes not cloudy, not lost or dull.

She stayed clean, had one more son,
And for a while, she had finally won.
But demons don‚Äôt sleep, and wounds don‚Äôt lie,
She slipped again ‚Äî I watched her try.

That son was placed in his father‚Äôs care,
But she didn‚Äôt vanish, she stayed right there.
She didn‚Äôt run, she didn‚Äôt fall,
She faced her shame, she gave her all.

Now she‚Äôs clean ‚Äî she‚Äôs held that line,
Each day she climbs, one breath at a time.
She‚Äôs here, she‚Äôs present, she‚Äôs doing her best,
And I‚Äôve seen the fight that lives in her chest.

I was the one who saw the pain,
Who took the smokes, who bore the rain.
I cooked the meals, I watched the door,
I hoped she‚Äôd walk back in once more.

I wasn‚Äôt just her child ‚Äî I was her light,
A silent warrior in the night.
And though we broke, and though we cried,
We never lost the love inside.

Because I am still her daughter ‚Äî that will never change,
Through the hurt, the healing, the broken, strange.
Through every relapse, every scar,
She is my mother ‚Äî near or far.

This is not a tale of shame,
This is a story that speaks her name ‚Äî
A name that fell but rose again,
A woman who‚Äôs more than just her pain.

So judge her not for what she‚Äôs done,
But for the battles she has won.
For rising after every fall,
For standing now, in spite of all.

And me? I carry both our truth,
The ache of loss, the fight of youth.
Still her daughter ‚Äî through it all,
And proud of how we rise, not fall.

    <h2>‚ÄúCrack Took My Peace, But I Took It Back"</h2><h3>‚Äî Anonymous </h3>
<p>I‚Äôve struggled with alcohol since I was old enough to drink. But the thing that really took over ‚Äî the thing that nearly destroyed me ‚Äî was crack. It started on New Year‚Äôs Eve, 2024. I was 25 years old, under a lot of stress, angry and overwhelmed. My girlfriend at the time used crack, and so did her friend. They offered me a hit. I said no at first. But eventually‚Ä¶ I gave in.

That one hit opened a door that was already cracked open ‚Äî a door I knew from childhood. My dad used crack, too. I watched it take him. I watched it change who he was. And later, as an adult‚Ä¶ I smoked it with him. I never imagined I‚Äôd get to that point, but when the trauma runs that deep, sometimes you normalize what once broke you.

My dad went to jail when I was a kid. He was gone for a few years. That left a hole in me I didn‚Äôt know how to name. I missed him ‚Äî even if I didn‚Äôt fully understand the damage. I think part of me always wanted to feel close to him again. Even if it meant joining in something that hurt us both.

So when I started smoking, it felt familiar. Like I was walking a path that had already been laid down for me. But that path led to destruction ‚Äî fast. My whole life became about chasing crack. Everything I did was built around getting it, smoking it, surviving until the next hit. I did things I hated just to keep the cycle going.

I grew up on the Rez. I lived with trauma, mental health struggles, pain, and grief that nobody ever really talked about. Alcohol was a part of life early on. Crack made it worse ‚Äî louder, darker, scarier.

I lost my dog ‚Äî my best friend. (He‚Äôs back with me now, thank Creator.) I lost my peace. I lost the version of myself that used to believe in life. I hated the things I was doing. I missed the person I used to be before everything got so chaotic.

Eventually, someone from my past came back into my life ‚Äî an ex, not the one I used with. She stood by me. She helped me stay grounded when I was barely holding on. She reminded me I could still be something other than what I‚Äôd become. I‚Äôll never forget that kind of loyalty. I wish everyone had that kind of support.

But it wasn‚Äôt just her. I got scared. Crack made life feel paranoid, loud, trippy ‚Äî like I was always floating just outside of myself. I wanted peace. I wanted calm. I was tired of surviving.

Telling my family was hard. Some didn‚Äôt know. Some walked away. I had to return to the Rez. I had to let go of people I once loved but knew weren‚Äôt safe for my recovery. I had to break generational patterns, even though part of me wanted to cling to them.

On May 13th, 2025, I finally stopped. For real. Fully.
As of today, I‚Äôm 47 days sober. This is the longest stretch I‚Äôve ever had.
I‚Äôve tried before ‚Äî relapsed a few times ‚Äî but this time, something clicked. I don‚Äôt crave it anymore. I don‚Äôt want it. I feel real. I feel proud. And I love being sober. For the first time in my life, I love me ‚Äî not the version I pretended to be, not the broken kid trying to follow his dad‚Äôs shadow. Me.</p>

    <h2>‚Äú I Was Becoming Who I Thought I Had to Be"</h2><h3>‚Äî Larissa </h3>
    <p> I was called a drug addict before I was ever even a drug addict. People looked at me and saw my parents ‚Äî both of them struggled with addiction ‚Äî and they just assumed I would, too. I hadn‚Äôt even started yet, but the label was already stuck to me. And eventually‚Ä¶ I gave in to it.

By 15, I had started using cocaine. It wasn‚Äôt constant at first. Just every now and then with friends, or with my boyfriend. We‚Äôd party, pass it around. It didn‚Äôt feel dangerous yet ‚Äî it felt like a way to feel something different. Like a shortcut to confidence, freedom, or at least some peace.

But when I moved away at 16, things spiraled fast. I started drinking alcohol every single day. I wasn‚Äôt partying anymore ‚Äî I was coping. Quietly. Alone. I felt sick all the time. I was disconnected from everything. Eventually, I got so sick that I had to be hospitalized. That‚Äôs when I had emergency gallbladder removal. I was 16 years old and already falling apart physically‚Ä¶ and no one really knew how bad it was emotionally.

You‚Äôd think that would‚Äôve been a wake-up call. It wasn‚Äôt. I kept using ‚Äî just shifted to different drugs. I started taking speed pills, and they took over quickly. I wasn‚Äôt in control anymore. I told myself I had it handled, but I was lying ‚Äî to myself and everyone else.

At 17, I collapsed. I was in intense pain and started peeing blood. I didn‚Äôt want to tell anyone what was happening. I didn‚Äôt want them to know what I‚Äôd been doing. But someone called an ambulance. I was scared ‚Äî really scared. I ended up being diagnosed with kidney stones. My body was starting to break down from the inside out.

Still, I didn‚Äôt stop. Not because I didn‚Äôt want to ‚Äî I did ‚Äî but because I didn‚Äôt feel like I could. I didn‚Äôt have the right support. I didn‚Äôt have the mental strength. And I didn‚Äôt have the belief that I could live any other way.

At that time, I was suffering from severe depression and mental illness that hadn‚Äôt even been fully diagnosed yet. I didn‚Äôt feel seen. I didn‚Äôt feel safe. I didn‚Äôt feel like I belonged anywhere. I had dark thoughts every day. Using helped numb it all ‚Äî the confusion, the trauma, the emptiness.

Add to that: our home was chaos. There was no structure. No consistent safety. Our house had become a party house ‚Äî what other kids called a ‚Äútrap house.‚Äù People came and went. Drugs were around all the time. And it wasn‚Äôt just me ‚Äî my brother was in it too. We were both caught in a system we didn‚Äôt build, trying to survive it however we could.

And at some point, I stopped even trying to be ‚Äúbetter.‚Äù I had a birth disease, and I honestly believed I was going to die young anyway. So my thinking became: ‚ÄúWhy not just live however I want?‚Äù

I thought that was freedom ‚Äî but it was just another kind of cage.

At 18, I was diagnosed with cirrhosis. Still, it didn‚Äôt scare me into quitting. That‚Äôs how numb I had become. How detached I was from the idea that my life had value.

But then came the moment that finally broke through: I had to be given Narcan. My body shut down. I couldn‚Äôt hold my head up. I couldn‚Äôt think. I was sweating, confused, and completely gone. I couldn‚Äôt remember the two days leading up to that moment. My mom had to call the ambulance. I remember bits of the pain ‚Äî and the fear. But mostly, I remember feeling like I had nothing left.

I didn‚Äôt have a big spiritual awakening or a perfect recovery plan after that. I didn‚Äôt check into the best rehab or write a speech about change. I just‚Ä¶ started to care. Maybe I got scared. Maybe I finally got tired. Maybe some part of me ‚Äî the part they said wouldn‚Äôt survive ‚Äî started to believe I was worth something.

I haven‚Äôt touched drugs since I was 19 years old. I‚Äôm 27 now.
Eight years clean. Eight years alive. Eight years choosing something different ‚Äî even when I didn‚Äôt always know what that meant.

I still don‚Äôt have it all figured out. But I know this: I‚Äôm not who they said I‚Äôd be. I‚Äôm not who I used to be. And I‚Äôm not going back.</p>

     <h2>‚ÄúIn Memory Of Jake"</h2> <h3>‚Äî Larissa </h3>
<p> Jake wasn‚Äôt just my ex ‚Äî he was my friend.
We had a history, yes. But even after we broke up, we stayed close. The bond never really went away. We didn‚Äôt get to see each other often, but when we did talk, it meant something. Deep conversations. Real understanding. It was one of those rare connections that never really fades.

The day I found out he was gone, it didn‚Äôt feel real.
I saw one post on Facebook ‚Äî it wasn‚Äôt from family, just someone saying he was missing. At first, I didn‚Äôt believe it. I kept checking, hoping it was a mistake or some confusion. Then I saw the updates: a search team was out, looking for him and the others after the boat had gone under. I just kept watching the news unfold ‚Äî helpless, silent, in shock.

By midnight, they found him.
He had already passed away.

There was no preparing for that. I couldn‚Äôt process it. I broke. I cried for days. For weeks.
I felt this mix of emotions that made it hard to breathe ‚Äî sadness so heavy it hurt physically, guilt I couldn‚Äôt explain, shame, anger. I questioned everything. I didn‚Äôt understand why or how it could happen ‚Äî or why someone like him, who had struggled and tried, had to go out that way.

Jake had battled addiction too. I knew his struggles. I never judged him for them. If anything, it made me want to love him more ‚Äî to see him win. I think a part of me hoped life would give him more time. He deserved that.

Grief hit me hard. I isolated myself.
It made death real ‚Äî too real. Not just something that happens ‚Äúsomeday,‚Äù but something that could come without warning. It changed the way I saw the world. It changed me.

And still‚Ä¶ he shows up.
In songs we both loved.
In dreams where he‚Äôs laughing or just there.
In dimes I find on the ground ‚Äî and somehow, I just know.
He‚Äôs reminding me that he‚Äôs still around, somehow.

If I could say one last thing to him, it would be this:
I miss you. I love you. I wish I had made more time. I wish I had seen you again. I would have.

His death became a turning point in my life. It forced me to reflect. To grow. To start asking myself what matters ‚Äî and what I‚Äôm doing with the time I still have.
It didn‚Äôt erase the guilt. But it gave it a shape I could learn to live beside.

Jake, wherever you are, I carry your memory with me.
Not just the grief ‚Äî but the laughter, the conversations, the pieces of you that still live in the things that move me.

This is a part of my grief story.
If you‚Äôre reading this and carrying a story of your own, just know:
You‚Äôre not alone. Your grief is valid. And your love still matters ‚Äî even after loss.</p>
