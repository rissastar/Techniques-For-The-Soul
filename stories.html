      <p>“Still Her Daughter - Spoken Word Poem”

By blood, by love, by fire and fight — we are still standing.

⸻

It started small — a silent crack,
When life first knocked my mother back.
A steering wheel, a cliffside bend,
A pain too loud she tried to end.

They called it a crash, said she fell asleep,
But it was grief that cut her soul too deep.
She didn’t want to die, just disappear,
From all the weight she held for years.

The wreckage left her back in pain,
Her eyes blackened, her soul stained.
That Christmas, she could barely see,
Still tried to smile for you and me.

They handed her pills with kindness blind,
Not knowing what they’d soon unwind.
Percocets for her broken spine,
But they numbed her heart and stole her mind.

What started as healing became a need,
An ache in her bones she had to feed.
And slowly, softly, she began to drift,
Her laughter quiet, her presence missed.

She’d lock the door and stay inside,
While parts of her began to hide.
I’d peek through cracks, see what I feared—
A mother close, yet never near.

She’d say she was working, off to bingo,
But night stretched long, and hope moved slow.
Sometimes she wouldn’t come home till dawn,
And I’d still be waiting with curtains drawn.

There were moments she tried — she truly did,
But addiction’s louder than love for your kid.
She went to rehab more than once,
And each time, I held onto hope like a punch.

But I remember the one time she left too soon,
Checked herself out beneath the moon.
Everyone thought she was healing that week,
But she was lost — I couldn’t speak.

And then the day that broke our backs —
July 1st, I remember the facts.
The doorbell rang, police in frame,
And I already knew, I felt the shame.

She was sleeping late — past noon,
And suddenly the world emptied the room.
My brother answered, I couldn’t breathe,
My mother crying, “Please, don’t leave!”

She fell to the floor, her voice a scream,
As they took her babies, stole the dream.
My sister was three, went to her dad,
Me and my brother — the system we had.

Our dad was drowning in his own despair,
So we were sent to foster care.
For 22 days, our Nan held tight,
But they took us again, said it wasn’t right.

Back and forth, to grandparents’ arms,
Trying to find peace, escape the harm.
But teens with trauma, anger, grief,
Don’t find calm or quick relief.

We didn’t know what “home” should mean,
Sometimes pushed love away unseen.
But finally, we found a place so warm —
A family who held us through every storm.

And all the while, my mom still tried,
Even as parts of her soul just cried.
She battled shame, she fought the tide,
She mourned the visits where she’d arrive —
Too late, too high, or not at all,
Still drowning in her painful fall.

I thought for years it was our fault,
That maybe we had caused her halt.
But it wasn’t us — it was the weight,
Of sorrow, guilt, and twist of fate.

In Alberta, we crossed paths once more,
She was pregnant, lost, and sore.
That baby boy she bore with grace,
Was taken from her — a missing face.

Adopted out, a ghost we know,
A brother whose name we don’t get to show.
I met him once — a fleeting smile,
My siblings haven’t, not in a while.

My sister too, was moved again,
Placed with kind and gentle kin.
And we were torn, across the land,
No games, no hugs, no holding hands.

Our childhood split, love on a clock,
Planned-out visits, padlocked talk.
And still, through all, she tried to mend,
To prove she could be mom again.

She came back once, I still recall —
Sober, smiling, standing tall.
Hair was cut, her face was full,
Eyes not cloudy, not lost or dull.

She stayed clean, had one more son,
And for a while, she had finally won.
But demons don’t sleep, and wounds don’t lie,
She slipped again — I watched her try.

That son was placed in his father’s care,
But she didn’t vanish, she stayed right there.
She didn’t run, she didn’t fall,
She faced her shame, she gave her all.

Now she’s clean — she’s held that line,
Each day she climbs, one breath at a time.
She’s here, she’s present, she’s doing her best,
And I’ve seen the fight that lives in her chest.

I was the one who saw the pain,
Who took the smokes, who bore the rain.
I cooked the meals, I watched the door,
I hoped she’d walk back in once more.

I wasn’t just her child — I was her light,
A silent warrior in the night.
And though we broke, and though we cried,
We never lost the love inside.

Because I am still her daughter — that will never change,
Through the hurt, the healing, the broken, strange.
Through every relapse, every scar,
She is my mother — near or far.

This is not a tale of shame,
This is a story that speaks her name —
A name that fell but rose again,
A woman who’s more than just her pain.

So judge her not for what she’s done,
But for the battles she has won.
For rising after every fall,
For standing now, in spite of all.

And me? I carry both our truth,
The ache of loss, the fight of youth.
Still her daughter — through it all,
And proud of how we rise, not fall.

By Larissa Wood

And me? I carry both our truth,
The ache of loss, the fight of youth.
Still her daughter — through it all,
And proud of how we rise, not fall.”</p>

      <h3>— Anonymous </h3>
      <p>“”

“I’ve struggled with alcohol since I was old enough to drink. But the thing that really took over — the thing that nearly destroyed me — was crack. It started on New Year’s Eve, 2024. I was 25 years old, under a lot of stress, angry and overwhelmed. My girlfriend at the time used crack, and so did her friend. They offered me a hit. I said no at first. But eventually… I gave in.

That one hit opened a door that was already cracked open — a door I knew from childhood. My dad used crack, too. I watched it take him. I watched it change who he was. And later, as an adult… I smoked it with him. I never imagined I’d get to that point, but when the trauma runs that deep, sometimes you normalize what once broke you.

My dad went to jail when I was a kid. He was gone for a few years. That left a hole in me I didn’t know how to name. I missed him — even if I didn’t fully understand the damage. I think part of me always wanted to feel close to him again. Even if it meant joining in something that hurt us both.

So when I started smoking, it felt familiar. Like I was walking a path that had already been laid down for me. But that path led to destruction — fast. My whole life became about chasing crack. Everything I did was built around getting it, smoking it, surviving until the next hit. I did things I hated just to keep the cycle going.

I grew up on the Rez. I lived with trauma, mental health struggles, pain, and grief that nobody ever really talked about. Alcohol was a part of life early on. Crack made it worse — louder, darker, scarier.

I lost my dog — my best friend. (He’s back with me now, thank Creator.) I lost my peace. I lost the version of myself that used to believe in life. I hated the things I was doing. I missed the person I used to be before everything got so chaotic.

Eventually, someone from my past came back into my life — an ex, not the one I used with. She stood by me. She helped me stay grounded when I was barely holding on. She reminded me I could still be something other than what I’d become. I’ll never forget that kind of loyalty. I wish everyone had that kind of support.

But it wasn’t just her. I got scared. Crack made life feel paranoid, loud, trippy — like I was always floating just outside of myself. I wanted peace. I wanted calm. I was tired of surviving.

Telling my family was hard. Some didn’t know. Some walked away. I had to return to the Rez. I had to let go of people I once loved but knew weren’t safe for my recovery. I had to break generational patterns, even though part of me wanted to cling to them.

On May 13th, 2025, I finally stopped. For real. Fully.
As of today, I’m 47 days sober. This is the longest stretch I’ve ever had.
I’ve tried before — relapsed a few times — but this time, something clicked. I don’t crave it anymore. I don’t want it. I feel real. I feel proud. And I love being sober. For the first time in my life, I love me — not the version I pretended to be, not the broken kid trying to follow his dad’s shadow. Me.
