    <!-- STEP TEMPLATE -->
    <div>
      <h3>Step 1: Honesty</h3>
      <p><strong>We admitted we were powerless over our addiction - that our lives had become unmanageable.</strong></p>
      <p>This step is about facing the truth. It means recognizing that willpower alone cannot conquer addiction. Admitting powerlessness is not weakness—it's the beginning of healing.</p>
      <p><em>Reflection Prompts:</em></p>
      <ul>
        <li>What does powerlessness mean to you?</li>
        <li>How has your life become unmanageable?</li>
        <li>What fears come up when thinking about surrendering control?</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Notes:</strong></p>
      <p style="min-height:120px; border:1px dashed #aaa; padding:10px;"></p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h3>Step 2: Hope</h3>
      <p><strong>Came to believe that a Power greater than ourselves could restore us to sanity.</strong></p>
      <p>This step is about believing that recovery is possible. Whether you believe in God, the universe, community, or inner strength, Step 2 invites you to open your heart to the possibility of healing.</p>
      <p><em>Reflection Prompts:</em></p>
      <ul>
        <li>What does “a Power greater than yourself” mean to you?</li>
        <li>What has helped you feel hope in dark times?</li>
        <li>How would your life look if you were restored to sanity?</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Notes:</strong></p>
      <p style="min-height:120px; border:1px dashed #aaa; padding:10px;"></p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h3>Step 3: Surrender</h3>
      <p><strong>Made a decision to turn our will and our lives over to the care of God as we understood Him.</strong></p>
      <p>This step is not about blind faith. It’s about letting go of self-will and trusting a process bigger than us. It invites peace and humility.</p>
      <p><em>Reflection Prompts:</em></p>
      <ul>
        <li>What parts of your life are hardest to surrender?</li>
        <li>What does trust look like for you?</li>
        <li>How do you feel when you let go of control?</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Notes:</strong></p>
      <p style="min-height:120px; border:1px dashed #aaa; padding:10px;"></p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h3>Step 4: Courage</h3>
      <p><strong>Made a searching and fearless moral inventory of ourselves.</strong></p>
      <p>This step asks us to look inward honestly. It's a deep dive into behaviors, resentments, fears, and harm done. It can be hard—but it’s powerful.</p>
      <p><em>Reflection Prompts:</em></p>
      <ul>
        <li>What patterns in your life cause pain?</li>
        <li>What fears drive your actions?</li>
        <li>What truths are you ready to face?</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Notes:</strong></p>
      <p style="min-height:120px; border:1px dashed #aaa; padding:10px;"></p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h3>Step 5: Integrity</h3>
      <p><strong>Admitted to God, to ourselves, and to another human being the exact nature of our wrongs.</strong></p>
      <p>This step is about accountability and connection. Speaking your truth out loud is freeing. You are not alone.</p>
      <p><em>Reflection Prompts:</em></p>
      <ul>
        <li>What’s it like to speak your truth?</li>
        <li>Who do you trust with your story?</li>
        <li>What do you most need to admit?</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Notes:</strong></p>
      <p style="min-height:120px; border:1px dashed #aaa; padding:10px;"></p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h3>Step 6: Willingness</h3>
      <p><strong>Were entirely ready to have God remove all these defects of character.</strong></p>
      <p>This step focuses on readiness for change—not perfection. It's a spiritual willingness to let go of old patterns, and open the door to transformation.</p>
      <p><em>Reflection Prompts:</em></p>
      <ul>
        <li>What behaviors are you willing to release?</li>
        <li>What still gives you comfort, even if it harms you?</li>
        <li>How ready are you to be free?</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Notes:</strong></p>
      <p style="min-height:120px; border:1px dashed #aaa; padding:10px;"></p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h3>Step 7: Humility</h3>
      <p><strong>Humbly asked Him to remove our shortcomings.</strong></p>
      <p>This step is about letting go of pride and ego. It’s about opening yourself up to growth and change with a humble heart.</p>
      <p><em>Reflection Prompts:</em></p>
      <ul>
        <li>What does humility mean to you?</li>
        <li>What gets in the way of asking for help?</li>
        <li>How do you experience grace?</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Notes:</strong></p>
      <p style="min-height:120px; border:1px dashed #aaa; padding:10px;"></p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h3>Step 8: Forgiveness</h3>
      <p><strong>Made a list of all persons we had harmed and became willing to make amends to them all.</strong></p>
      <p>This step is about recognizing the impact of our actions. It’s not about guilt—it’s about owning our part and being willing to heal relationships.</p>
      <p><em>Reflection Prompts:</em></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Who have you hurt through your addiction?</li>
        <li>What would healing those relationships look like?</li>
        <li>What does forgiveness (for others and yourself) mean?</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Notes:</strong></p>
      <p style="min-height:120px; border:1px dashed #aaa; padding:10px;"></p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h3>Step 9: Justice</h3>
      <p><strong>Made direct amends to such people wherever possible, except when to do so would injure them or others.</strong></p>
      <p>Amends are more than apologies—they’re about taking responsibility and repairing trust. This step must be done with care and courage.</p>
      <p><em>Reflection Prompts:</em></p>
      <ul>
        <li>What amends are you ready to make?</li>
        <li>How can you show you've changed?</li>
        <li>How can you practice justice gently?</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Notes:</strong></p>
      <p style="min-height:120px; border:1px dashed #aaa; padding:10px;"></p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h3>Step 10: Perseverance</h3>
      <p><strong>Continued to take personal inventory and when we were wrong promptly admitted it.</strong></p>
      <p>This step invites daily self-awareness. It’s a practice of checking in, correcting course, and growing in integrity over time.</p>
      <p><em>Reflection Prompts:</em></p>
      <ul>
        <li>How do you practice daily reflection?</li>
        <li>What helps you admit when you're wrong?</li>
        <li>How can you make self-inventory a habit?</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Notes:</strong></p>
      <p style="min-height:120px; border:1px dashed #aaa; padding:10px;"></p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h3>Step 11: Awareness</h3>
      <p><strong>Sought through prayer and meditation to improve our conscious contact with God as we understood Him.</strong></p>
      <p>This step is about spiritual connection. It's a chance to deepen your inner life and stay grounded in peace, love, and purpose.</p>
      <p><em>Reflection Prompts:</em></p>
      <ul>
        <li>What does conscious contact mean to you?</li>
        <li>How do you connect spiritually or mindfully?</li>
        <li>What does your inner voice sound like?</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Notes:</strong></p>
      <p style="min-height:120px; border:1px dashed #aaa; padding:10px;"></p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h3>Step 12: Service</h3>
      <p><strong>Having had a spiritual awakening as the result of these steps, we tried to carry this message to others and to practice these principles in all our affairs.</strong></p>
      <p>This step is about giving back and living the program. It’s about being of service, living your truth, and helping others on their journey.</p>
      <p><em>Reflection Prompts:</em></p>
      <ul>
        <li>How has your spirit changed during this process?</li>
        <li>Who can you support in their healing?</li>
        <li>What does recovery mean to you now?</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Notes:</strong></p>
      <p style="min-height:120px; border:1px dashed #aaa; padding:10px;"></p>
